## Abstract

This repository focuses on the analysis of violent crime data in the Montgomery County area. The project utilizes the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) dataset, which captures detailed information on offenses, offenders, victims, and properties. By conducting a thorough analysis of this dataset, we aim to enhance the quality of crime statistics and derive meaningful insights into crime patterns.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the crime data of Montgomery County, Maryland. It is an open-source database that is continuously updated. The dataset covers a time period starting from July 1, 2016. While the dataset includes NIBRS codes, they are not categorized in any specific order.

## Scope of Research for the Project

The primary objective of this research is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the crime dataset. We will employ various statistical methods to improve data credibility and highlight relevant crime statistics. The ongoing nature of the dataset allows for continuous analysis and exploration. Initial data analysis and exploratory data analysis (EDA) have been performed to address the research questions.

## Research Questions

1. What are the percentages of crimes according to crime type and NIBRS A category crime data?
2. How can we graphically represent the distribution of crimes across different locations and their respective rates?
3. What is the frequency of crime in different police districts? Which police district has the highest and lowest number of cases?
4. How can we create a map representation of crime names in the Montgomery area using latitude and longitude values from the crime data?
5. What is the monthly analysis of crime data based on crime categories? Which months have higher crime rates compared to others?
6. How does crime data vary across the years 2016-2022 based on offense codes?
7. Can we identify the time of occurrence for crimes in a day (morning/evening)?
8. Which street types (AL, AVE, BLV, etc.) have a higher number of crimes?
9. How can we analyze and visualize the number of violent crimes for each police agency?
10. What is the average number of crimes per day?

Please refer to the project documentation for detailed analysis, methodologies, and visualizations addressing these research questions.
